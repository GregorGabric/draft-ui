## Examples

<Callout type="important">
  **`Input`** is a primitive component, it is not meant to be used on it's own.
  Typically, it is used in any component that handles raw text, such as
  **`TextField`**, **`NumberField`**, **`SearchField`**, and **`ComboxBox`**.
</Callout>

### Default

The default **`Input`** uses size `md`.

<ComponentExample name="Input" story="default" />

### Size

You can use the `size` prop to alter the input size. Sizes `xs`, `sm`, `md`, and `lg` are included by default.

<ComponentExample name="Input" story="sizes" />

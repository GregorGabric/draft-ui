## Installation

1. Copy and paste the following code into your project.

This is the `<Radio />` primitive. You can place it in a file at `components/ui/Radio.tsx`.

## Usage

Copy and paste the code examples below into your project.

<ComponentSource src="../../packages/ui/src/Radio.tsx" />

## Examples

> **Note** 
> **`Radio`** is a primitive component, it is not meant to be used on it's own. It should always be be wrapped in a **`RadioGroup`** and accompanied by a **`Label`**.

### Default

The default **`Radio`** uses size `md`.

<ComponentExample name="Radio" story="default" />

### Sizes

You can use the `size` prop to alter the **`Radio`** size. Sizes `sm`, `md`, and `lg` are included by default.

<ComponentExample name="Radio" story="sizes" />

### Disabled

{/* TODO */}

**Coming soon:** An exmaple showing a disabled **`Radio`**

## Installation

1. Copy and paste the following code into your project.

This is the `<ProgressBar />` primitive. You can place it in a file at `components/ui/ProgressBar.tsx`.

## Usage

Copy and paste the code examples below into your project.

<ComponentSource src="../../packages/ui/src/ProgressBar.tsx" />

## Examples

> **Note**
> Althought similar to **`Meter`**, **`ProgressBar`** is used to represent progress. In other words, it would typically be used in circumstances that start at zero and tend toward completion. For example: Loading progress, download progress, or battery charge progress.

### Default

This is the default **`ProgressBar`**

<ComponentExample name="ProgressBar" story="default" />
